## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **Full macOS Support**: ClawBridge is now officially compatible with macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon).
- **Service Management (Launchd)**: Support for macOS `launchd` via `.plist` agents for background execution and auto-restart.
- **Cross-Platform CI**: Automated tests and lint now verify stability on both Linux and macOS.

### Fixed
- **Network Compatibility**: Resolved issues with `hostname -I` by implementing a multi-fallback logic (`ip route` -> `hostname` -> `ifconfig`), ensuring reliability on Alpine Linux, WSL, and macOS. (Special thanks to [@StewartLi666](https://x.com/StewartLi666) for the feedback)
- **Sed Compatibility**: Fixed script errors caused by `sed -i` differences between GNU/Linux and BSD/macOS.
- **VPN & Networking**: Fixed VPN interface detection and service restart logic for macOS.
- **Quick Tunnel Reliability**: Improved reliability when fetching and displaying Cloudflare Quick Tunnel URLs after updates.
- **Systemd Log Hint**: Corrected `journalctl` command hints to accurately reflect user-level vs system-level services.

- New Full-screen Login Page with modern UI and breathing background.
- Notice overlay for legacy magic link attempts.
- Brute-force protection: max 10 login attempts per IP per 60s.
- Mandatory confirmation for high-risk endpoints (`/api/kill`).
- Rate limiting for destructive endpoints.
- Jest + Supertest test suite with unit and API integration tests. (Thanks [@yaochao](https://github.com/yaochao) for suggesting #7)
- ESLint + Prettier code style enforcement. (Thanks [@yaochao](https://github.com/yaochao) for suggesting #7)
- GitHub Actions CI workflow running tests and lint on every push. (Thanks [@yaochao](https://github.com/yaochao) for suggesting #7)
- Split `public/index.html` into separate `public/css/dashboard.css` and `public/js/dashboard.js` for maintainability. (Thanks [@yaochao](https://github.com/yaochao) for suggesting #3)

- Bug: Removed hardcoded paths for better environment portability. (Thanks [@yaochao](https://github.com/yaochao) for reporting #5)
- Bug: Improved stability in context reading when session files are missing.

### Changed
- Refactored installer (`setup.sh`) to remove magic link output in favor of secure login.
- Refactored: split monolithic index.js (~600 lines) into modular src/ directory. (Thanks [@yaochao](https://github.com/yaochao) for suggesting #3)
- Replaced `wget` with Node.js native `https` module for binary downloads. (Thanks [@yaochao](https://github.com/yaochao) for reporting #6)
