# ClawBridge Dashboard 🌉

**ClawBridge** (formerly ClawLink) is a lightweight, real-time mission control center designed for **Clawdbot** and **OpenClaw** agents.

It provides a mobile-friendly interface to monitor your AI agent's "brain" (thinking process), "hands" (tool execution), "wallet" (token usage), and "schedule" (cron jobs) form anywhere via a secure Cloudflare Tunnel.

## ✨ Features

### 👁️ The All-Seeing Eye (Real-time Feed)
- **Mind Reading**: See exactly what your agent is thinking (`🧠 Thinking...`).
- **Tool Inspection**: Watch live tool executions (`🔧 grep`, `🔧 web_search`).
- **File Watcher**: Get notified when files are created (`📄`) or modified (`📝`).
- **Process Monitor**: Detects background scripts (`📜`) and high CPU usage (`⚡`).
- **Persistent History**: Auto-saves activity logs so you can review past actions.

### 💰 Token Economy
- **Cost Tracking**: Real-time calculation of Input/Output tokens and USD costs.
- **Trend Chart**: 7-day visual history of your AI spending.
- **Model Breakdown**: See which models (Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek) are costing the most.
- **Drill-down**: Click on any day to see detailed stats.

### 🎮 Mission Control (Cron)
- **Live Status**: View all scheduled Clawdbot tasks.
- **Next Run Predictor**: Countdown to the next execution (e.g., `🔜 14:05 (in 45m)`).
- **Manual Trigger**: Force run any task immediately with a single tap.
- **Health Check**: Visual Red/Green indicators for task success/failure.

### 🛡️ Enterprise-Grade Stability
- **Secure Access**: Magic Link authentication (no passwords, key-based).
- **Auto-Healing**: Systemd services ensure the dashboard and tunnel auto-restart on failure.
- **Zero-Config Tunnel**: Built-in Cloudflare Tunnel management.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone & Install
Clone this repository into your Clawdbot skills directory:

```bash
cd /root/clawd/skills
git clone https://github.com/dreamwing/clawbridge-openclaw-mobile-dashboard.git clawbridge-dashboard
cd clawbridge-dashboard
npm install
