## 🚀 Quick Start (Install Script)

The easiest way to install or update ClawBridge.

1.  **Run the installer**:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dreamwing/clawbridge-openclaw-mobile-dashboard/master/install.sh | bash
    ```

2.  **Access**: The script will output a magic URL (e.g., `http://YOUR_IP:3000/?key=...`). Open this on your phone.

## ⚙️ Manual Installation

If you prefer to set it up yourself:

1.  **Clone the repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dreamwing/clawbridge-openclaw-mobile-dashboard.git
    cd clawbridge-openclaw-mobile-dashboard
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install --production
    ```

3.  **Configure**:
    Copy the example configuration:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then edit `.env` to set your `ACCESS_KEY` (use a strong random string).

4.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

## 🧩 Configuration

### Custom Model Pricing
ClawBridge comes with a comprehensive pricing list (`data/config/pricing.sample.json`). To customize rates:

1.  Copy the sample to the active config:
    ```bash
    cp data/config/pricing.sample.json data/config/pricing.json
    ```
2.  Edit `data/config/pricing.json`. Keys match the model names in your logs (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o`).

### PWA (Add to Home Screen)
1.  Open ClawBridge in Safari (iOS) or Chrome (Android).
2.  Tap **Share** -> **Add to Home Screen**.
3.  Launch it like a native app (full screen, no address bar).

## 🔒 Security Note
*   ClawBridge runs locally on your server.
*   Data is stored in `data/` and is **NOT** uploaded to any cloud.
*   Ensure your firewall allows traffic on Port 3000 (or use a Tunnel).
